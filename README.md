# React-portfolio

## Commands:

* `npm start` to run locally
* `npm run deploy` to deploy to the gh pages branch and update https://rlew631.github.io/portfolio/

## Task List:

- [ ] figure out how to speed up load time (especially first load)
    - look into [deadfile](https://m-izadmehr.github.io/deadfile/#/)
    - also look into `service worker` at the end of `index.js` 
- [ ] trim down unnecessary css
- [ ] make icons on simpleicons for ros and gazebo to put in "toolkit"
- [ ] add projects:
    - Covid Project (maybe in a new section for collaborative projects)
    - icons for simpleicons and ion icons. Wait until doing both and make single card in collaborative projects
    - CNC router project
    - This website
- [ ] update projects:
    - For the drone project put stuff about control systems in description and start being sure to align keywords in the project descriptions more. Also add a link to one of the youtube videos.
    - For the drone and FSAE cars put in a grabcad link. Make the chrome icon for now if not available but make a grabcad icon for sure. It's not in IonIcons but looks open source and can contribute
    - For the subaru project put in a picture of the actual engine, maybe the drivetrain laid out on the table at work.
- [ ] make a set of colored buttons which let you toggle between "all", "electromechanical engineering", and "Data science" categories
- [ ] in the toolkit add a section for engineering and a section for project management
- [ ] in project info/portfolio code change "projecttools" to "pythontools" and create a category for more generic/soft skills
- [ ] fix the x button on the popup window so it's not highlighted by default
- [ ] see if the entire box can be made to zoom when hovering over, not just the picture. related to modal
- [ ] add soft skills where relevant. Maybe resource planning, conflict mediation, training etc.
- [ ] remove the "impacts" section from the drone paper, reread the rest and make sure to update the TOC
- maybe add a picture or keep the picture in the popup. Something where it's just the box that zooms/rearranges instead of a seperate window would be slick. for now take the first picture that's in the preview and figure out a gallery style way of viewing the pictures.
    - Add pictures from the portolio folder on my windows laptop so there's some sort of scrolling images for the car popups. Also add the connecting rod 1 and 2 pictures. Should probably be converted to step, run FEA on it to do a buckling analysis and done as a 4 pane pic(1,2,FEA1,FEA2)

## Maybe List:

- Update RL logo to site caliper/code logo
- adding a less obtrusive modal for the popups in portfolio
- create a website for the zooplankton project which operates in real time?
- put the logic diagrams from the github projects on the pages for project descriptions. Maybe also just completely copy the github descriptions to flesh them out a bit
